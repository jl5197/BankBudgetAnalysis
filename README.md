# BankBudgetAnalysis
### Drafting a Python script to analyze a bank's financial data
-------

At this point, Galaxy Bank is holding a weekly meeting to evaluate its financial performance since last fiscal year.

Instead of analyzing budget data with the usage of common excel tools, the financial director recruit me, as a part-time data analyst and ask me to present the summary of the financial record of Galaxy Bank in a more concise and easy-to-read way. 

*Python* is my first option for DATA ANALYSIS AND VISUALIZATION. 

Then I create a script to generate a summary of Galaxy's financial performance, by listing the following key numbers:
- Total number of months involved
- The net total amount of "Profit/Losses"
- The average of the changes in "Profit/Losses"
- The greatest increase in profits (date and amount)
- The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount)
